# Portfolio-Project-1:  U.S. Medical Insurance Costs

## Scope

### First : Inspect the insurance.csv file and Import the dataset
I began by opening the data file (insurance.csv) in MS Excel and saving it as an Excel file where I formated the data into a table to inspect the data. I created several pivot tables to use to check against the python methods.

I will need to convert the BMI column from a string into an integer inorder to SUM and AVG the data. There are no signs of missing or problematic data. There are no ids or unique row identifiers.

### Second:  I will analyze each column of data in a Jupyter Notebook by:

* finding the average age of the patients
* counting the number of males vs. females in the dataset
* finding the unique geographical locations (regions) of the patients
* returning the average yearly medical charges of the patients

### Third: I will create a dictionary that contains all patient information and use it to return the:

* Count Average Age by sex
* Average charges by region
* Count of patients by region
* Sum of charges by region
* Number of patients by smoker status
* Average Yearly Medical Insurance Charges by BMI and by Sex
* Average Yearly Medical Insurance Charges by BMI

## In the end...
I ended up taking four passes through the data.  First I used MS Excel and pivot tables to orient myself.  Next I used a simple dictionary, followed by using pandas, and finally I used class to organize methods. I learned alot.
